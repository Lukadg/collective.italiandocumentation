Adding Pages
=================

Pages in Plone vary greatly, but are single "web pages," of one sort or
another.

To add a page, use the *Add new...* menu for a folder:

.. figure:: ../_static/copy_of_addnewmenu.png
   :align: center
   :alt: 

Select **Page** from the drop-down menu, and you'll see the *Add Page*
panel:

.. figure:: ../_static/editpagepanelplone3.png
   :align: center
   :alt: 

The **Title** and **Description** fields are there at the top. Fill each
of them out appropriately. There is a *Change note* field at the bottom,
also a standard input that is very useful for storing helpful memos
describing changes to a document as you make them. This is useful for
pages on which you may be collaborating with others.

The middle panel, **Body Text**, is where the action is for pages. The
software used for making Pages in Plone, generically called *visual
editor* and specifically a tool called TinyMCE, is a most important
feature allowing you to do WYSIWYG editing. WYSIWYG editing -- *What You
See Is What You Get* -- describes how word processing software works.
When you make a change, such as setting a word to bold, you see the bold
text immediately.

People are naturally comfortable with the WYSIWYG approach of typical
word processors. We will describe later in this manual. Your
site-administrator may also enable so-called `markup
languages <http://plone.org/documentation/manual/plone-4-user-manual/adding-content/adding-pages#footnotes>`_
for your site.
