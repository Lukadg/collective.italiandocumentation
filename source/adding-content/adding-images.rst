Adding Images
==================

Adding images to a Plone web site is a basic task that may involve a
little work on your local computer, but is essential, because
photographs, maps, and custom graphics are so important on web sites.

**`Preparing Images for the
Web <http://plone.org/documentation/manual/plone-4-user-manual/adding-content/preparing-images-for-the-web>`_**

**Remember to use web-standard file formats for all images. Acceptable
formats include: JPG, JPEG, GIF, and PNG. Do not use BMP or TIFF formats
as these are not widely supported by web browsers.**

When you are ready to upload an image, use the *Add new...* drop-down
menu (You will only see the *Add new...* menu after logging in):

.. figure:: ../_static/add-item-menu-image.png
   :align: center
   :alt: add-item-menu-image.png

After clicking to add an **Image**, you'll see the *Add Image* panel:

   :align: center
   :alt: add-image.png

The Title and Description fields (field, as in "data input field") are
there, as with adding a Folder, and at the bottom there is a place to
upload an image. Let's look at the three input fields individually:

-  *Title* - Use whatever text you want, even with blanks and
   punctuation (Plone handles web addressing).
-  *Description* - Always a good idea, but always optional. Leave it
   blank if you want.
-  *Image* - The Image field is a text entry box along with a Browse...
   button. You don't have to type anything here; just click the Browse
   button and you'll be able to browse you local computer for the image
   file to upload (*Remember*: You need to *remember* where you keep
   your images on your computer).

For images, at a minimum, you will browse your local computer for the
image file, then click **Save** at the bottom to upload the image to the
Plone web site. You'll have to wait a few seconds for the upload to
complete (or a minute or so, if you have a slow Web connection). A
preview of the uploaded image will be shown when the upload has
finished.

As of Plone 4, images and files that are uploaded into Plone have their
IDs (URLs) based on the title that is given to the image (instead of the
file name of the image or file). Since the title field is not required,
if you do not fill it out, the name of the item will default to using
the name of the file in place of the title.
