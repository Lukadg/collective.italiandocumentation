Managing Portlets
======================

How to add, remove, and rearrange portlets.

To begin manipulating portlets, you must find the **Manage Portlets
link**, usually located on the bottom of each side column. Under Manage
Portlets, you can create new Portlets, remove Portlets, rename and
rearrange Portlets.

|Portlet manage link|
---------------------

Clicking on this link will take us to a new page that will allow us to
edit the Portlets. The other method of getting to this screen is by
adding /@@manage-portlets to the end of the page URL that we want to
edit the Portlets on. For example, to edit the Portlets on the About Us
Page, the URL would end up being
www.myplonesite.org/about/@@manage-portlets.

Adding a Portlet
----------------

Adding a Portlet is as simple as selecting the **Add Portlet** drop down
box and clicking on the type of Portlet you would like to add. We will
cover the different options available in the next section.

Editing an Existing Portlet
---------------------------

To edit the properties of an existing Portlet, simply click on the name
of the Portlet. In the example to the left, if we wanted to edit the
properties of the Navigation Portlet, we would Click on *Navigation*.
Each type of Portlet will have different configuration options available
to it.

Rearranging Portlets
--------------------

To Rearrange your Portlets, simply click the **blue up or down arrow**.
This will affect the order your Portlets are displayed on the page.

Removing Portlets
-----------------

To remove a Portlet, click the **red "X"** associated with its name.

Hiding Portlets
---------------

From Plone 4 on you can show/hide portlets using the associated
show/hide links present.

As you may have noticed on the Manage Portlet screen, you have the
ability to work with Portlets on both the right and left side of the
page. This is because there are two columns for Portlets to be in, a
left column and a right column. **Portlets will only appear on the side
that you add them on**.

With Portlets, you can add more than one of the same type on a page.
There is no limit to how many times you can use an individual Portlet or
a limit to how many total Portlets can be on a Page.
