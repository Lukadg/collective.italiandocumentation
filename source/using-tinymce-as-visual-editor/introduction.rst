Introduction to TinyMCE.

TinyMCE is a platform independent web based Javascript HTML WYSIWYG
editor. What this means is that it will let you create html content on
your web site. TinyMCE supports a lot of Operating Systems and browsers.
Some examples are: Mozilla, Internet Explorer, Firefox, Opera, Safari
and Chrome. TinyMCE has a large userbase and an active development
community.

TinyMCE is the default visual editor starting from Plone 4.0, although
Kupu is also available for users who prefer it. TinyMCE was decided to
be shipped as default because Kupu wasn't being well-maintained, whereas
TinyMCE had a much broader use in other communities, as well as a better
plugin story and some other usability niceties as adding both internal
and external links via the same button.
